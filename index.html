            <h1>The GOAT</h1>
            <p>Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985 and was named Ronaldo after the then US President Ronald Reagan. He grew up in a poor family and had to share a bedroom and bathroom with his older brother and two older sisters. He started playing soccer at an early age when he was just eight.</p>

                <h3>Career at Real Madrid</h3>
                <p>During the course of his nine seasons as a Real Madrid player, Ronaldo secured a number of impressive records: the club's all-time leading goalscorer, the leading marksmen in European Cup history (he scored 105 goals for Real Madrid in the Champions League); the all-time leading madridista goalscorer in LaLiga (312); highest number of games in which a player has scored three or more times in LaLiga history (34); and the most goals to have been scored by a Real Madrid player in a single season (61).

                    During his time at the club, he also clinched the record for the most goals scored in a Champions League campaign (17) and ended the competition as the leading goalscorer on six occasions. Club president Florentino Pérez labelled him as "the heir to Alfredo Di Stéfano”, and just like Don Alfredo, he has left an indelible mark on the history of the best club in the world.</p>

                <h3>Career at Juventus</h3>
                <p>This spring, when Juventus’s directors agreed to commit some $387 million to signing Ronaldo, the reigning world player of the year — a $133 million transfer fee for Real Madrid and, roughly, $254 million in salary and taxes over the next four seasons — they did not do so to boost Serie A’s self-esteem.

                    They did so, partly, because the 33-year-old Ronaldo represented the club’s best chance of ending its long, agonizing wait to win a third Champions League title. Juventus has lost two of the last four finals, to Barcelona in 2015 and to Real Madrid, and Ronaldo, in 2017. Despite seven straight Serie A titles under his stewardship, to Andrea Agnelli, Juventus’s president, going one step further in Europe now ranks as somewhere between a mission and an obsession.
                    
                    This summer, the club jettisoned its longstanding policy of slow, steady growth in favor of immediate success: Agnelli brought Leonardo Bonucci, the Italy defender, back to Turin after a season at A.C. Milan and, more important, worked with Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo’s agent, to complete what has been called il colpo del secolo: the deal of the century. Ronaldo has won three Champions Leagues in a row, and five over all. He is the competition’s all-time leading scorer. If anyone can deliver European domination, he can.</p>

                <h3>Career at Manchester United</h3>
                <p>At Euro 2008, Ronaldo’s future was again the subject of claim and counter-claim. Happily, in the end, he pledged his allegiance to United, although ankle surgery delayed his start to the 2008/09 campaign. He made his return as a substitute against Villarreal in the Champions League and was given a rousing home reception. Two months later, his 100th Reds goal arrived against Stoke City at OT on 15 November 2008.

                    Ronaldo’s magical 2008 was rounded off with another string of individual honours. In October he was named FIFPro Player of the Year, and in December became the first United player since George Best in 1968 to be awarded the prestigious Ballon d’Or trophy. To cap it off, in January 2009, he became the first Red to win the FIFA World Player of the Year award. "This is the climax of a fantastic era," he said. "I'm lucky to be part of United's history. It's one of the most important moments of my life, I hope to be back in this position again."</p>
